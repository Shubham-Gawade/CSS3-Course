				Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
				Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
				While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
				As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
				`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -
				Only this, and nothing more.'

				Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
				And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
				Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow
				From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -
				For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -
				Nameless here for evermore.
